# Player-2
Attempted development of a neural network to play a simple game
Java in Processing.

The game itself is a simplified version of the Royal Game of Ur, which plays a lot like Frustration.
In this simplified game, the goal is to get all 7 pieces across the board.
The board is 8 spaces long, and landing on top of another player's piece sends them to the start.
You cannot land on a space with your own token on it.
The rolling system is from 0 to 4, with 4 coin flips of either 0 or 1 added up.

V2 plays 2 AI players against each other forever.
